# mslearn-python-oo

I started the Python Seekho Challenge, which was initiated by MLSA MUET Khairpur.

Contains the exercise for a Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) LEARN module.

These exercises are currently used in:

- [Introduction to object-oriented programing with Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/python-object-oriented-programming/)
