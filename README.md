# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

I am learning Python on the Microsoft Learn site, and this game is an exercise from the OOP module.
If you are getting errors in running the code, I just want to tell you that it is still under development. I hope I'll complete it in the coming week. Thanks!
These exercises are currently used in:

- [Introduction to object-oriented programming with Python] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/python-object-oriented-programming/)
